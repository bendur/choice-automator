## Choice Automator

Choice Automator is a tool for making random choices from a set list of options. Choice history is preserved, and you can choose whether to include the previous choices as options for your next set of choices.

### Setting Up A Development Environment

Choice Automator requires a CFML engine like [Lucee](https://lucee.org). I recommend setting it up using [CommandBox](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox).

1. Run `box start` in the src directory. 
2. Wait for the CFML server to start up and automatically open a browser window.
